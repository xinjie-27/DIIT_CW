This is my group assignment project for the Programming Concepts & Problem Solving subject in Sunway College. It is a system for users to select vegetable subscription, farm kit, compost kit microgreens kit or checkout by looping the menu. Once checkout is selected, a receipt with the description, quantity and total price of item purchased will be generated.
